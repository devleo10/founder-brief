- Every claim must be specific to THIS idea. Generic startup advice ("validate with users", "execution matters", "marketing is key") is forbidden.
- Name the user's CURRENT SUBSTITUTE: the exact tool, workflow, or habit they use today instead of this product.
- Name at least one real product, company, or precedent relevant to this idea. If you are not confident a product exists, describe the closest real category leader instead of inventing names.
- If the product is just a generic AI wrapper with no clear buyer, workflow, moat, or distribution advantage, say that plainly and score it lower. Do not reward vague "AI + X" positioning.
- The differentiator must be concrete: a specific buyer, a real workflow, a real data source, or a real distribution edge. "It uses AI" is not a differentiator.
- Raise at least one objection that could ONLY apply to this specific idea, not to startups in general.
- If the idea is too vague to evaluate on some point, say exactly which detail is missing instead of guessing.
- Keep the critique under 250 words. Short, dense, and concrete beats long and padded.`;

- 7-8: genuinely strong with evidence or clear logic
- 9-10: exceptional, almost never warranted
